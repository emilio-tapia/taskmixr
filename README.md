> 🧑‍🚀 **Imagine this scene...** You have some house chores for you and your family. Your siblings argue between them about the house chore they have to do. You do not want to have problems. That is why a **RANDOM TASK ASSIGNER** comes to play. Have fun!

## 🚀 How to use?

> 1. Input the names and taks.
> 2. Push the random button.
> 3. You can write a custom title that reflects the tasks you are going to do.
> 4. Save the results that make all of you happy.
> 5. In the bottom section, each result is stored individually by the date, you can find the custom title in right side of each result.
